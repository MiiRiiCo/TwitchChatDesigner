Known Issues:

 - You cannot customize the chat with the Designer.html anymore after you replaced the data.js . Instead you can still change the data.js itself to change the style but be careful not to break anything

-------------------------

Comming soon:

 - Animations for new, moving and outfading messages
 - Additional design options for messages from subscribers, VIPs and bots
 - Support for emotes from bttv, 7tv, etc.
